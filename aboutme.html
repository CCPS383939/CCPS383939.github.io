      <h1 About Me</h1>
      <p> I'm working towards being a honest, humble, helping person. There have been many hard experiences that I've had faced in my life that make want to be that type of person i want to become. I want to become a therapist or a nurse. I know that I can be someone in life and I choose to be that.
 I've been trying to do my best in school despite all the things that I faced or am facing. I always work hard in school and make sure to get the good grades and good GPA. join some clubs.
Honesty, trustworthiness, non-judgmental, and hardworking are values that I find to be most necessary for my success. There's a lot of people in this world that don't have those values, and because of that may have lost jobs. or maybe viewed as a bad person. I want the opposite of that. 
graduate high school with scholarship so i wont put my parents through so much.
dependable, generous, quiet(sometimes), kind. </p>
